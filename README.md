# SnowAlbedoTestbed
This is the repository for the Snow Albedo Testbed Scoping project. Here you will find our annotated bibliography and a whitepaper that both serve as living documents to inform the snow albedo community about previous work and data sets.
This project is composed of six areas:
1. Snow albedo parameterizations for Earth System models
2. Snow physical parameters (e.g., grain size and light absorbing particles)
3. Snow albedo assimilation in Land Surface Models
4. Atmospheric correction of snow and snow/cloud discrimination
5. Calibration and validaton of snow physical properties
6. Inventory of snow reflectance/BRDF/albedo data products
